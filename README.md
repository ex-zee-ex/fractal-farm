a processing sketch for exploring chaotic structures inherent in feedback systems
there are controls, every ascii key on your keyboard does something, and i highly reccomend using with a midi controller with at least
8 knobs/sliders because some of the controls ended up working far better in a knob twiddling than key pressing situation.  I recommend reading through the code as well, its pretty decently annotated and theres some useful information in various forms located throughout.
